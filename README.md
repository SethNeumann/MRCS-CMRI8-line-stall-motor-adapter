DThis is part of our 8 line (byte-wide) adapters for classic CMRI boards such as the DIN/DOUT [24/32] and SMINI.  By mixing and matching you can convert the male 
Molex (0.156) pins to screw terminal breaks in 0.100", 3.5mm, 0.156" or RJ45.  This board supports the simple "shunt" style stall motor control suggested by 
Dr. Chubb in his CMRI User's manual  Version 3.0 on pages 3-14  and 3-15.
